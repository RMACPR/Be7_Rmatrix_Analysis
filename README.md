# Be7_Rmatrix_Analysis
R-matrix analyses of the Be7 system
This data development project aims at comparing currently available R-matrix codes and creating a common platform where input and output resonance parameters can be exchanged by these codes independently of the specific formats and approximations used.  The comparison of the codes is split in three parts: in part I the objective is to compare R-matrix algorithms and how they are implemented in the R-matrix codes. An exercise was defined for this purpose where participants were expected to calculate R-matrix cross sections for well-defined conditions. In part II the minimization routines implemented in the codes for fitting experimental data will be assessed using the same light system and initial conditions. Finally, in the third part (part III) we will perform an evaluation of the given system, using the same experimental database.
